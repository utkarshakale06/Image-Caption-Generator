# ML_PROJECT
 Image Caption Generator Project: Create an innovative Image Caption Generator using machine learning. This project employs advanced neural network architectures to analyze images and generate descriptive captions automatically. Enhancing accessibility and understanding, the model undergoes rigorous training and evaluation to ensure relevant output


# Image Caption Generator

This project aims to create an image caption generator using deep learning techniques. The model is based on a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- Keras
- Numpy
- PIL
- Matplotlib
- tqdm

## Setup

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy Pillow matplotlib tqdm
```

### Dataset

1. Download the [Flickr8k dataset](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398).
2. Extract the dataset and organize it with images in one folder (`Flicker8k_Dataset`) and text data in another (`txt`).
3. Ensure that the text data contains a file named `Flickr8k.token.txt` with image captions.
